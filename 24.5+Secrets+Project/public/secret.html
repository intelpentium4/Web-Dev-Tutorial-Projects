  <h1>Secrets</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>I graduated from Brooklyn College in 2019 with a B.S majoring in Computer Science (3.306 GPA). </li>
    <li>Since then, I haven't been able to get an entry level job because all junior developer positions require at least 3 years of experience.</li>
    <li>There is no way someone fresh out of college can have that so it is a catch 22 situation. 
      As a result, I've worked in other fields but I continued to learn C.S related material on Udemy. </li>
    <li>I've even had an offer that bind me to a contract. They trained me in web development which include Java, Spring Boot, MYSQL and Angular. 
      But what I didn't know was they would fabricate my resume making up 5 years of experience as a full stack software engineer. </li>
    <li>I broke the contract and worked at a garage selling car parts on ebay.</li>
    <li>I'm disappointed that coming out of college for 5 years, I have yet to break into the field that I'm most passionate about. 
      I hope "insert potential host here" can help me find my starting point.</li>
  </ul>
