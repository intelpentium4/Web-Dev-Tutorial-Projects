<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  The car that I should've had if I had gotten a job back then.
  I graduated from Brooklyn College in 2019 with a B.S majoring in Computer Science (3.306 GPA).
  Since then, I haven't been able to get an entry level job because all junior developer positions require at least 3 years of experience.
  There is no way someone fresh out of college can have that so it is a catch 22 situation. 
  As a result, I've worked in other fields but I continued to learn C.S related material on Udemy. 
  I've even had an offer that bind me to a contract. They trained me in web development which include Java, Spring Boot, MYSQL and Angular. 
  But what I didn't know was they would fabricate my resume making up 5 years of experience as a full stack software engineer. 
  I broke the contract and worked at a garage selling car parts on ebay.
  I'm disappointed that coming out of college for 5 years, I have yet to break into the field that I'm most passionate about. 
  I hope "some random mofo company" can help me find my starting point.
